# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-25)

**Core value:** A user can edit semantic document text naturally, repaginate following content, and export a visually consistent, selectable, form-capable PDF.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Accessible Rich-Text Editing

## Current Position

Phase: 2 (Accessible Rich-Text Editing) — EXECUTING
Plan: 8 of 18
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-09-14 — Plan 02-07 completed; ready for durable visible and keyboard structural product paths

Progress: Phase 2 — 7/18 plans complete; milestone percentage unavailable while later phases remain unplanned.

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 13
- Average duration: not comparable (Plan 05 was a multi-session closeout)
- Total execution time: multi-session

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 6 | - | - |
| 2 | 7 | multi-session | - |

**Recent Trend:** Schema-v2 tree and lossless migration gates remain green. Plan 02-07 now passes exact split/merge/cross-block algebra, bounded deletion preimages, field-safe tombstones, recovery tamper rejection, and the full Rust/WASM/web gate; eleven editor plans remain.
**Per-Plan Metrics:**

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 1 P01 | 40 min | 3 tasks | 16 files |
| Phase 1 P02 | 27min | 2 tasks | 17 files |
| Phase 1 P03 | 35min | 3 tasks | 13 files |
| Phase 1 P04 | 30min | 3 tasks | 13 files |
| Phase FLOWPDF-01 P05 | 7d-multi-session | 3 tasks | 18 files |
| Phase FLOWPDF-01 P06 | 46min | 3 tasks | 15 files |
| Phase FLOWPDF-02 P01 | 17m 7s | 2 tasks | 11 files |
| Phase FLOWPDF-02 P02 | multi-session | 2 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase FLOWPDF-02 P03 | multi-session | 2 tasks | 28 files |
| Phase FLOWPDF-02 P04 | resumed multi-session | 2 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase FLOWPDF-02 P05 | resumed multi-session | 2 tasks | 16 files |
| Phase FLOWPDF-02 P06 | resumed multi-session | 2 tasks | 14 files |
| Phase FLOWPDF-02 P07 | resumed multi-session | 2 tasks | 9 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `.planning/PROJECT.md`.

- FlowDocument is canonical for reflow; PDF remains a derived or native fixed-layout representation.
- Rust is the sole semantic authority on native and WASM targets; TypeScript constructs DTOs, performs physical browser I/O, and renders verified results.
- UI, keyboard, API, and future voice input share one typed transactional command service with revision checks, deterministic undo/redo, and explicit anchor invalidation.
- Browser durability is acknowledged only after one atomic IndexedDB transaction completes and Rust revalidates the recovered record set; exact retries converge and divergent writes conflict.
- Canonical UTF-8 bytes, UTF-16 public positions, contiguous schema migrations, provenance, and closed audit projections are versioned and deterministic; hashes prove consistency rather than external authenticity.
- [Phase 2]: Candidate fallback is allowed only across predeclared exact versions; missing or contradictory official evidence is terminal.
- [Phase 2]: npm legitimacy uses exact-release age; crate legitimacy uses package inception age while retaining exact-release evidence.
- [Phase 2]: ICU segmentation is locked to compiled_data and image decoding to PNG/JPEG with default Cargo features disabled.
- [Phase 2]: WASM size evidence binds stable provenance identities and verified executable bytes; live observation timestamps do not affect determinism.
- [Phase 2]: Frozen legacy decoders precede schema changes; v2 uses one canonical inline-run tree with retained block style defaults.
- [Phase 2]: Stored migration-only review states remain explicit; new authoring rejects them and plain commands reject unsupported rich targets atomically.
- [Phase 2]: ICU byte boundaries are translated to UTF-16 in one bounded linear pass; editor sessions remain noncanonical, revision-bound, and immutable at the WASM boundary.
- [Phase 2]: ReplaceSelection validates directional grapheme endpoints in Rust, persists only through the existing guarded planner, and publishes React text only after durable commit plus Rust re-query.

### Pending Todos

- Verify and pin the fixed Vitest Browser Mode family through the dependency-provenance workflow before any non-local Browser Mode exposure; see Phase 1 `deferred-items.md`.

### Blockers/Concerns

- The Rust text/font stack requires an early differential benchmark against HarfBuzz reference behavior.
- Before the Phase 2 final gate, fix WASM size measurement semantics: both current-source variants now link ICU. Keep historical admission evidence unchanged; do not claim a fresh Phase-1-compatible delta from that harness. See 02-03-SUMMARY.md.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Compatibility | Advanced layout, encryption, signatures, PDF/A, PDF/UA and broad malformed-PDF repair | v2 | Initialization |
| Security | Verify and pin the fixed Vitest Browser Mode family | Open | Phase 1 Plan 06 |
