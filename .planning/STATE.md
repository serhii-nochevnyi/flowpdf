# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-14)

**Core value:** A user can edit semantic document text naturally, repaginate following content, and export a visually consistent, selectable, form-capable PDF.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Durable Flow Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Durable Flow Foundation)
Plan: Not yet planned
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-14 — Project research, requirements and roadmap initialized

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:** No execution data yet.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `.planning/PROJECT.md`.

- FlowDocument is canonical for reflow; PDF remains a derived or native fixed-layout representation.
- The implementation is writer-first and uses a Rust core compiled to native and WebAssembly.
- Work is sequential because one autonomous executor owns the entire implementation.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Rust is not installed in the current workspace environment; Phase 1 bootstrap must install and pin the toolchain.
- The Rust text/font stack requires an early differential benchmark against HarfBuzz reference behavior.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Compatibility | Advanced layout, encryption, signatures, PDF/A, PDF/UA and broad malformed-PDF repair | v2 | Initialization |
